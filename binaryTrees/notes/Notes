Trees by Jenny


Tree, graphs are non linear
Non-linear = multiple levels
data is in the form of hierarchy
heirarchial relationship between them

Tree can have different defn in math, graphs, trees

traversal is always top to bottom

Collection of elements/nodes which are linked together to simulate a heirarchy



Root = top most element, no parent, first element
Element = Nodes are elements
Node = stores some information, and has link
Parent node = immediate Predecessor/previous node of the current node
Child node = immediate successor/next of node
Leaf node = no child node
Non leaf node = at least one child
Edge = Link between two nodes
Path = sequence of consecutive edges from source to destination nodes
ancestor = any predecessor node on the path from root to current node
descendants = any successor node on the path from root to current node
subtree = node with all descendants
sibling = children of same parents
degree = number of children of that node
degree of tree = max degree of any node
depth of node = length of path from root to the current node
height of node = number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf
height of tree = from root, longest path
level of node = number of edges from root to the current node = depth of node


nodes = (n-1)edges


Binary tree = tree with all nodes at most 2 children



Binary Tree:
    each node can have at most 2 children

Level 1 = 0
Level 1 = 2
Level 1 = 4
Level 1 = 8
Level 1 = 16
At each level, max node possible is 2^level

Max node at height = 2^(h+1) -1
Min node at height = 1


Binary tree types
Full binary/string
    Each node should have 2 children except leaf node
    Each node should either have 2 or 0
Complete binary tre
    If all the levels are completely filled except the last level
    Nodes should be as left as possible
Perfect binary tree
    All nodes have 2 children and all leaf are at the same level
Degenerate binary tree:
    all internal nodes have only 1 child
    left skewed binary tree, right skewed binary tree
