# TODO: Study
# We can easily solve this problem in linear time using some extra space.
# The idea is to create two auxiliary arrays where each index of the
# first array stores the maximum element to the left,
# and that of the second array stores the minimum element to the right.
# We find an index whose value is greater than the maximum value to its
# left but smaller than the minimum value to its right after filling up
# both arrays.

    if n <= 2:
        return -1

    # `left[i]` stores the maximum element in sublist `nums[0â€¦i-1]`
    left = [None] * n
